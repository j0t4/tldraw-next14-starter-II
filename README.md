# TLDRAW NEXT JS 14 (APP style) starter template.
## Updated to tldraw 3.2.0

## LOOSED: "File open" and "File save" menu from last starter due ...
##   "const store = useSync({ ..." do not export "loadSnapshot(store, ..."
##                                 neither       "getSnapshot(store)"
## Client and server cooperative user experience 

### Client: npm run dev --> http://localhost:3000
### Server: npm run server --> http://localhost:5858
### room: (fixed) --> test-room
